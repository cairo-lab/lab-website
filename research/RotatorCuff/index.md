This work is a collaboration with out VA partners in Utah. The VA has the largest genomics database (over a million patients). This dataset is a goldmine for all kinds of discoveries. But what do you do when your phenotype requires reading thousands and thousands of medical images? You join forces with an AI lab. Here we are working on autoomating measurement across shoulder MRIs at a scale never done before.
