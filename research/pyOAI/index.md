This repo is a collection of scripts for navigating and making sense of the Osteoarthritis Initiative dataset. With over 11,000 variables tracked for almost 5,000 patients, this project is a medical goldmine. It is also less than trivial to get a sense of where to start. The scripts in this repo are an attempt to help by making public the initial code that any researchers would need to write to use the data outside of SAS.

The only request in using this library is that you mention it in the acknowledgements when you publish. Maintaining this code takes time from research work. Doing so is worth it if more people benefit and contribute.
